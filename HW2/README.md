Weicheng Wang's Homework 2:


1. neuralnetwork has 3 function.

    In initializing function, it automaticlly initialize a random theta matrix fit for the input size.
    In forward function, it calculates the output number using 3 loops of theta matrix
    In function getlayer, it receives the theta layer.
    
 2. logicgate has 4 classes
    AND OR NOT are simple using the neuralnetwork to build.
    XOR uses the classes above to build.
