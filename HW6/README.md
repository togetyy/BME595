The homework is divided into 2 parts.

However, because haiguang has used up all gpu resourses, I did not use gpu to test. (Otherwise he will not graduate by time....)

Though I have finished the homework, I haven't tested it. So if there are any problems in the homework, please blame on haiguang. (just a joke. And fire to me instead)

Finally, I am not sure whether it is available that we only change the last layer of alaxnet because alaxnet has 3 fullly connected layers and if we only changes the last fully connected layer, the model will get into error at the first fully connected layer.
Or is it fine?

I do not know
